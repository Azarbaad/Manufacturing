# Manufacturing Sensor Data Analysis & Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project demonstrates how production sensor data from a manufacturing environment can be analyzed to detect abnormal machine behavior and support operational decision-making.

The focus is on **time-series sensor data**, commonly generated by industrial machines, and on translating raw signals into **actionable insights** such as early warnings for process deviations, equipment issues, or efficiency losses.

The project simulates realistic production data and applies anomaly detection techniques that are widely used in modern manufacturing analytics platforms.

## Manufacturing Context
In manufacturing environments, machines continuously generate sensor data such as:
- Temperature
- Pressure
- Vibration
- Cycle time

These signals reflect the health and performance of production processes.  
Small deviations can indicate:
- Emerging equipment failures
- Material inconsistencies
- Process drift
- Increased downtime risk

The goal of this project is to show how analytics can help identify such issues **early**, enabling proactive intervention instead of reactive troubleshooting.

## Problem Statement
Manufacturing teams often struggle with:
- Large volumes of noisy sensor data
- Detecting abnormal behavior in real time
- Understanding *which* signals matter most
- Acting quickly before performance degrades

This project addresses these challenges by:
- Structuring time-series production data
- Detecting anomalies across multiple sensors
- Framing results in an operational, decision-oriented way

## Data Description
The dataset represents simulated production sensor data from a single machine.

**Sensors included:**
- `temperature` – machine operating temperature
- `pressure` – process pressure level
- `vibration` – mechanical vibration indicator
- `cycle_time` – production cycle duration

**Characteristics:**
- Time-stamped at 1-minute intervals
- Includes normal operating behavior
- Injected anomalies simulate abnormal machine conditions (e.g. wear, misalignment)

The data is intentionally designed to resemble real manufacturing data:
- Slightly noisy
- Multi-sensor
- Time-dependent
